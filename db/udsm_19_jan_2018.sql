(2, 'Background', 'Utangulizi', '<p>The Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) was established on 17th October, 1978 in accordance with the University<br />\r\nof Dar es Salaam Act 1970. It is located in Zanzibar in the premises of the former East African Marine Fisheries<br />\r\nResearch Organization (EAMFRO) and has a mariculture substation in Pangani. The Institute was established<br />\r\nwith the following aims and objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe primary objective of the Institute is to undertake research in all aspects of Marine Sciences.<br />\r\nThe Institute shall provide postgraduate studies in Marine Sciences.<br />\r\nProvide advisory and consultancy services in Marine Affairs.<br />\r\nIn future and in accordance with the country&#39;s manpower demand, the Institute shall establish undergraduate<br />\r\nstudies in Marine Sciences.<br />\r\nThe Institute shall be engaged in exploitation of Marine Resources as part of merging theory and practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Institute is organized into three sections, namely:<br />\r\nPhysical and Environmental Marine Sciences (PEMS)<br />\r\nMarine Biology and Resources Management (MBRM)<br />\r\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nPEMS and MBRM are academic sections while ICT is a cross-cutting section. The ICT section apart from<br />\r\ncarrying out normal IT responsibilities provides GIS services and houses the National Oceanographic Data<br />\r\nCentre (TzNODC), and the Marine Education Extension Development (MEED) unit. The MEED unit is the<br />\r\noutreach arm of the Institute as its main function is to translate scientific/research findings into a simple language<br />\r\nfor the various stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe Institute has a good range of oceanographic equipment for field work. It also has well equipped research<br />\r\nlaboratories and there is ample working space for visiting scientists and postgraduate students. Through the Sida<br />\r\nMarine Sciences Bilateral Programme, the Institute provides scholarships for postgraduate studies in Marine<br />\r\nSciences. The Institute maintains good collaboration with donor agencies such as IOC, Sida, CIDA, UNEP,<br />\r\nUNESCO, IUCN, WWF, IFS, the World Bank, and many others. By maintaining a clearly focused research<br />\r\nagenda, the Institute has been able to contribute to the national development, economically and scientifically. The<br />\r\nInstitute&#39;s Research Agenda identifies four broad themes of focus for the next ten years 2014-2023.

It also has well equipped research<br />\r\nlaboratories and there is ample working space for visiting scientists and postgraduate students. Through the Sida<br />\r\nMarine Sciences Bilateral Programme, the Institute provides scholarships for postgraduate studies in Marine<br />\r\nSciences. The Institute maintains good collaboration with donor agencies such as IOC, Sida, CIDA, UNEP,<br />\r\nUNESCO, IUCN, WWF, IFS, the World Bank, and many others. By maintaining a clearly focused research<br />\r\nagenda, the Institute has been able to contribute to the national development, economically and scientifically.

The fee is expected to cover for Internet services, Electricity, Office and Lab space, as well as other Institutes&rsquo; administrative costs.&nbsp; Costs for the use of high tech lab facilities and their related reagents are charged separately. Other services such as fax, international calls, photocopy etc. are charged according to the actual usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LABORATORIES AND THEIR USE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All IMS laboratories have specific regulations and guidelines. The regulations and guidelines depend on the type of activity conducted in a specific laboratory. Before engaging yourself to a specific laboratory, it is your responsibility to ensure that you know the regulations of the laboratory you are working at.<br />\r\nFurthermore, as most of the laboratories and facilities experience high demand, you need to ensure that your planned activity is approved by the Superintendent of Laboratories&nbsp;<strong><u>prior&nbsp;</u></strong>to commencement.&nbsp; For those visiting scientists intending to dive during their visit, they are advised to bring their own diving gears such as regulators, BCDs, masks, snorkels, fins, diving boots and wet suits as IMS has very limited stock of diving gears and there are plenty of users. However, IMS may be able to provide tanks and dive weights.<br />\r\nIn the event of an equipment breakdown, or if you use the last bit of a particular chemical, it is&nbsp;<strong><u>your responsibility</u></strong>&nbsp;to report this immediately to the technician in-charge or head of the Superintendent of the laboratories.&nbsp; Failure to do so may result in refusal for you to use IMS equipment and/or other resources.<br />\r\nObviously it pays to be courteous to your fellow researchers, so please take think about others working (ongoing experiments) around you, or other people who may wish to use the same laboratory resources.<br />\r\nPlease note that it is not allowed to keep wet clothes in the visiting scientists&rsquo; room or any other place in the laboratories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRANSPORT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute does not provide field transport. However, it may assist in getting the service from car renters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BOATS:&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe Institute owns a boat, which can be hired (in case it is not engaged by other research activities) at a nominal fee, which is usually 10% lower than the market price. Below are the current charges in Tanzanian Shillings for hiring a boat outside the Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that the charges may fluctuate with season. Should you wish to use one of the Institute&rsquo;s boats then you have two options: Either<br />\r\n(a) You provide the fuel, pay the assistants and pay 20% of the market price;&nbsp;<strong>or&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n(b) You pay 90% of the market price and be provided with fuel and boatman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, you will be requested to deposit some money with the Institute&rsquo;s Accountants&rsquo; office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing="0" style="width:720px">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Destination</th>\r\n			<th style="text-align:center; vertical-align:baseline">Cost in TZS</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Chumbe</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">120,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Bawe</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">80,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Changuu</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">70,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Chapwani</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">80,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Morogo</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">80,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Nyange</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">90,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Pange</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">80,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">Pwakuu</td>\r\n			<td style="text-align:left; vertical-align:baseline">90,000</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WORK SCHEDULE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are required to provide a work plan to the Associate Director (through your local supervisor) and a progress report detailing your activities and venues at the beginning of each month in order to facilitate:-</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Smooth operation of your scheduled activities.</li>\r\n	<li>Transport/boats arrangements.</li>\r\n	<li>Notification of the government local authorities responsible throughout the geographic areas you intend to be operating.

It is advisable that payment of allowances for assistants, etc, be made at the accounts office. You are therefore advised to deposit some money at the accounts office which can be used for this purpose. However, payment to people outside IMS should be done directly by yourself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that the assistants may also be engaged with other researchers/visiting scientists at IMS. Before engaging them with your research you are required to consult your local supervisor at the Institute and the Superintendent of Laboratories (with details of your field plan) for approval in order to avoid confusion. Please note that activities such as making appointments with offices outside IMS or visiting other Government institutions can be done by yourself in consultation with the Associate Directors&rsquo; Office (which could assist in making the appointments for you on request).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACCOMMODATION</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the Institute does not provide accommodation to visiting researchers. However, it assists in obtaining them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INSURANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note that the Institute&nbsp;<strong><u>does not</u></strong>&nbsp;provide insurance cover for visitors. The Institute is, therefore, in no way responsible for any damage or accident (at sea or on land) that may occur to any visitor.<br />\r\nPlease make sure you have signed the Visitors form which is available at the desk of the Secretary for the Visiting Scientists/Students on your arrival at the institute. This is for record purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MEDICAL ASSISTANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In case you need to see a Doctor please contact the In-Charge of Visiting Scientists or Associate Director for assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have some medical facilities for emergency use in our dispensary located at the ground floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEPARTING IMS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of your stay it is expected that any equipment you have used is returned to its correct place, and any problems that you may have encountered with it have been reported to the laboratory staff. Furthermore, in case you have spent the last bit of a specific chemical or laboratory item, please ensure that the item has been reported to the Technician in-charge so that it can be replaced or renewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, since your visit to IMS will hopefully be productive, it is expected that all visiting researchers present a report and/or a seminar to the IMS staff so that we can all share the new knowledge generated by your research. It will also be gratefully appreciated if you could send a copy of any published material resulting from your work at IMS. We also encourage joint publications with IMS scientists that have assisted you in your work preparation and implementation.

(37, 'Welcome to IRA', 'Welcome to IRA', '<p>The Institute of Resource Assessment (IRA) is a multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary research institute dealing with issues related to natural resource assessment and environmental management in general including climate change adaptation and vulnerability assessments. During the last fifty years, the Institute of Resource Assessment, formerly Bureau of Resource Assessment and Land Use Planning (BRALUP) established in 1967, has acquired vast experience in developing integrated methodologies and techniques involving local communities in planning and management of natural resources for sustainable development. BRALUP was established as an applied research wing within the <a href="http://www.udsm.ac.tz/" target="_blank">University of Dar es Salaam</a> (UDSM) with an objective to supporting the <a href="http://www.tanzania.go.tz/" target="_blank">Government of Tanzania</a> in planning and assessment of both human and natural resources. In July 1982, BRALUP was elevated to a fully-fledged Institute of the UDSM, and was established in accordance with the UDSM Act of 1970.

During the last fifty years, the Institute of Resource Assessment, formerly Bureau of Resource Assessment and Land Use Planning (BRALUP) established in 1967, has acquired vast experience in developing integrated methodologies and techniques involving local communities in planning and management of natural resources for sustainable development. BRALUP was established as an applied research wing within the <a href="http://www.udsm.ac.tz/" target="_blank">University of Dar es Salaam</a> (UDSM) with an objective to supporting the <a href="http://www.tanzania.go.tz/" target="_blank">Government of Tanzania</a> in planning and assessment of both human and natural resources. In July 1982, BRALUP was elevated to a fully-fledged Institute of the UDSM, and was established in accordance with the UDSM Act of 1970. Since its establishment, the institute has undertaken applied research in the focal areas of natural resources, environment (including environmental impact assessment), water resources, agricultural systems and food security, social and policy analysis, population and human settlements patterns. Climate change adaptation and vulnerability assessment has also been an important focus area.

The Institute of Resource Assessment, has managed numerous projects in developing countries that range in size and complexity from small workshops to very large multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, multi-country projects that involve multi-national investigators. IRA projects are executed in partnership with regional centers, developing country institutions and international organizations (e.g. IDRC, Mc Arthur Foundation, IGBP, WCRP, IHDP, WMO, UNEP, UNITAR, and SEI). The IRA role in these projects includes project planning and management, scientific direction, financial management, technical support, training, management of scientific peer review, performance monitoring, and report preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt="Context of our work" src="http://www.ira.udsm.ac.tz/images/stories/Home/Context-of-our-work.png" /></p>\r\n', '', NULL, '', 'institutes/ira/about/context-of-our-work', '2017-11-14 10:51:58', 1, 22, '');

The Documentation Unit is fully computerized, and over 450 papers and books have been catalogued and linked to the Main Library Computerized Open Public Access Catalogue (OPAC). That means readers can access documents successfully from the University Main Library website. The computer facilities owned by the Institute offer several services including running a computerized information system in Natural Resources and the Environment; data processing and analysis of GIS activities; image processing; word processing; and database management including EIA. The IRA website is up and running, providing information to our stakeholders. The Institute&rsquo;s website is linked to other websites such as the government website, the Climate Change and Adaptation in Africa (CCAA), REDD website, Open Society Foundation (formerly the Open Society Institute) project website and others. Computers are provided to IRA&rsquo;s academic staff, GIS lab and also to students&rsquo; computer rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Library Services and Documentation</strong><br />\r\nIRA has a documentation unit that organizes and provides reading materials, photocopying, and other documentary services to institute staff, other university staff, graduate and undergraduate students. The unit has a stock of IRA publications dating back to 1967 when BRALUP was first established.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>About 400 Titles (BRALUP/IRA Papers, Reports, Notes and Service Papers from 1967-2002 (6)-General Collection = 3, 700 (books etc)</li>\r\n	<li>Theses = 63</li>\r\n	<li>Conference collection = 56</li>\r\n	<li>Periodical collection (journals) = 493</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</strong><br />\r\nAccessibility to computer facilities is vital for efficient handling and processing of data/information. The Institute has made substantial efforts in procuring new computers to keep pace with advances in Information Technology. The Institute has sufficient computers, Plotters, Scanners and printers. The computer facilities offer several services including running a computerized information system in Natural Resources and the Environment; data processing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) activities; image processing; and database management. A computer has also been installed in the documentation unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute has a Website hosted at University of Dar es Salaam Computing Center (UCC). All offices have computers with internet connections. The Institute has several scientific and field equipments, for example, electronic projector, GPS, digital cameras, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tanzania Natural Resource Information Center (TANRIC)</strong><br />\r\nTanzania Natural Resource Information Center was established by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1994 and is housed at and managed by IRA. The government?s decision to locate the TANRIC in IRA is a testimony of the Institute?s strength in matters related to natural resource management in Tanzania. The Center was established with financial assistance from the World Bank as part of the Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP) of the Tanzania Government.For many years since its establishment, the Institute (BRALUP/IRA) has accumulated and acted as a repository for data and which those who need it are gradually incorporating into databases for use. The data categories available in TANRIC include population, meteorology, forestry, various publications and GIS materials and equipment. Thus, IRA is an important source of information for storage, manipulation and supply to other users. Beneficiaries of information stored at TANRIC are students, the public, University staff, and other national, regional and international institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IRA has the potential, capacity and manpower in Remote Sensing and GIS. The Institute has pioneered Remote Sensing in Tanzania since 1972 for land use planning, resource assessment and environmental monitoring and management. The Institute has a remote sensing laboratory, which includes a comprehensive collection of air photos dating back from the 1950s, satellite images, and equipment for visual interpretation, image processing and photography. The Institute also possesses a GIS laboratory with five digitizing tables and two HP DesignJet plotters. IRA serves a wide range of customers in the field of remote sensing and GIS technology. Software used includes ArcView, ArcGIS 8.x and ArcInfo. . One of the activities related to GIS that IRA did on behalf of the Government of Tanzania, was the work on the National Reconnaissance Level Land Use and Natural Resource Mapping, which was a component of the Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP). This project utilised the Landsat TM of 1994/95 and SPOT satellite data sets to produce land cover and land use maps for the whole country at the scale of 1:250,000. All the materials produced (both in hard copies and in digital formats), and the equipment used in this project were deposited at IRA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aerial photo/remote sensing laboratory</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Aerial photo collection from 1950s to 1970s covering about 60% of the country.</li>\r\n	<li>Satellite images collection in hard copies and chips 70x70 for the period 1972-1980 with Additive Colour Viewer</li>\r\n	<li>Hard copies and Digital data of Land Sat TM images from 1980-1995 covering the whole country at a scale of 1:250,000.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institutional capacity of IRA reflects the current capacity in terms of human resources, physical resources, research and training experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Human Resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>IRA is a multidisciplinary institution with both academic and technical staff.

The Documentation Unit is fully computerized, and over 450 papers and books have been catalogued and linked to the Main Library Computerized Open Public Access Catalogue (OPAC). That means readers can access documents successfully from the University Main Library website. The computer facilities owned by the Institute offer several services including running a computerized information system in Natural Resources and the Environment; data processing and analysis of GIS activities; image processing; word processing; and database management including EIA. The IRA website is up and running, providing information to our stakeholders. The Institute&rsquo;s website is linked to other websites such as the government website, the Climate Change and Adaptation in Africa (CCAA), REDD website, Open Society Foundation (formerly the Open Society Institute) project website and others. Computers are provided to IRA&rsquo;s academic staff, GIS lab and also to students&rsquo; computer rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Library Services and Documentation</strong><br />\r\nIRA has a documentation unit that organizes and provides reading materials, photocopying, and other documentary services to institute staff, other university staff, graduate and undergraduate students. The unit has a stock of IRA publications dating back to 1967 when BRALUP was first established.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>About 400 Titles (BRALUP/IRA Papers, Reports, Notes and Service Papers from 1967-2002 (6)-General Collection = 3, 700 (books etc)</li>\r\n	<li>Theses = 63</li>\r\n	<li>Conference collection = 56</li>\r\n	<li>Periodical collection (journals) = 493</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</strong><br />\r\nAccessibility to computer facilities is vital for efficient handling and processing of data/information. The Institute has made substantial efforts in procuring new computers to keep pace with advances in Information Technology. The Institute has sufficient computers, Plotters, Scanners and printers. The computer facilities offer several services including running a computerized information system in Natural Resources and the Environment; data processing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) activities; image processing; and database management. A computer has also been installed in the documentation unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute has a Website hosted at University of Dar es Salaam Computing Center (UCC). All offices have computers with internet connections. The Institute has several scientific and field equipments, for example, electronic projector, GPS, digital cameras, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tanzania Natural Resource Information Center (TANRIC)</strong><br />\r\nTanzania Natural Resource Information Center was established by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1994 and is housed at and managed by IRA. The government?s decision to locate the TANRIC in IRA is a testimony of the Institute?s strength in matters related to natural resource management in Tanzania. The Center was established with financial assistance from the World Bank as part of the Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP) of the Tanzania Government.For many years since its establishment, the Institute (BRALUP/IRA) has accumulated and acted as a repository for data and which those who need it are gradually incorporating into databases for use. The data categories available in TANRIC include population, meteorology, forestry, various publications and GIS materials and equipment. Thus, IRA is an important source of information for storage, manipulation and supply to other users. Beneficiaries of information stored at TANRIC are students, the public, University staff, and other national, regional and international institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IRA has the potential, capacity and manpower in Remote Sensing and GIS. The Institute has pioneered Remote Sensing in Tanzania since 1972 for land use planning, resource assessment and environmental monitoring and management. The Institute has a remote sensing laboratory, which includes a comprehensive collection of air photos dating back from the 1950s, satellite images, and equipment for visual interpretation, image processing and photography. The Institute also possesses a GIS laboratory with five digitizing tables and two HP DesignJet plotters. IRA serves a wide range of customers in the field of remote sensing and GIS technology. Software used includes ArcView, ArcGIS 8.x and ArcInfo. . One of the activities related to GIS that IRA did on behalf of the Government of Tanzania, was the work on the National Reconnaissance Level Land Use and Natural Resource Mapping, which was a component of the Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP). This project utilised the Landsat TM of 1994/95 and SPOT satellite data sets to produce land cover and land use maps for the whole country at the scale of 1:250,000. All the materials produced (both in hard copies and in digital formats), and the equipment used in this project were deposited at IRA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aerial photo/remote sensing laboratory</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Aerial photo collection from 1950s to 1970s covering about 60% of the country.</li>\r\n	<li>Satellite images collection in hard copies and chips 70x70 for the period 1972-1980 with Additive Colour Viewer</li>\r\n	<li>Hard copies and Digital data of Land Sat TM images from 1980-1995 covering the whole country at a scale of 1:250,000.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '', NULL, '', 'institutes/ira/about/institutional-capacity', '2017-10-30 20:49:43', 1, 22, 'institutes/ira/about/');

(75, 'Background of School', 'Kumbukumbu ya Uanzishwaji wa Shule Kuu', '<p><strong>University of Dar-es-Salaam School of Law &ndash; A Synopsis</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The University of Dar-es-Salaam School of Law (then Faculty of Law &ndash; herein referred to the School) is the oldest law training institution in East Africa. It was established on Wednesday, 25<sup>th</sup> October 1961, three months before independence, to cater for the new emerging independent states of East Africa, comprising of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. The first batch of students at the School was admitted at the then Tanganyika National Union (TANU) (Now Sukita) Building along Lumumba Street in Dar-es-Salaam. By virtue of its establishing Instrument, the School was affiliated to the University of London awarding degrees of that University through external programs. In principle its curriculum was premised along the law curriculum of the University of London. The establishment of the School at the eve of independence provided an opportunity for the creation, innovation and introduction into the syllabus local case materials, which were sensitive to the aspirations of new independent States of East Africa, despite its attachment to the University of London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was made possible by, among other factors, the fact that the School was comprised of young dynamic scholars from diverse jurisdictions who advocated for change. These included A.B Weston an Australian recruited from Canada who served as Dean, William Twinning a UK citizen recruited from the Sudan and Patrick Mc Aulsan also from the UK. Others were Sol Piccioto from the UK and trained in Chicago, Mr. Pink, an African American legal scholar from the USA, Cranford Platt a Canadian who was the Principal and Mr. Snaith the planning officer from the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At inception, the mission of the School was to provide the new independent states of East Africa with indigenous skilled lawyers in the shortest time possible to work in the government and public service. When formally inaugurating the University College of Dar-es-Salaam, (As the Faculty of Law was referred to then), on 25<sup>th</sup> October 1961, the late Mwalimu Nyerere (then Chief Minister and &ldquo;Visitor&rdquo; to the College) aptly summarized the reasons underlying the establishment of the School. He stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;[This] College has been established in a rush. Recommendations for opening a University College of Tanganyika had been put at a much later date as the operative one, but my government felt that this was a matter of highest educational priority&hellip;[This] was a political decision&hellip;..An independent country depending on charity for all its higher educational opportunities is in great psychological danger. But the decision to start the first Faculty in 1961 and to proceed as rapidly as possible was an educational decision meant to increase opportunities for university education for all citizens&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In setting a direction for the approach in teaching courses at the School, the late Mwalimu Nyerere stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;We are in the process of building up a Tanganyika nation&hellip;[If] we are to build a sturdy sense of nationhood, we must nurture our own educated citizens (who) must have an African oriented education. That is, an education which is not only given in Africa, but also (that which is) directed at meeting the present needs of Africa. For our present plan must be that directed at reaching the villages&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the government&rsquo;s approach therefore, despite the School being affiliated to the University of London upon inception, the focus of the curriculum was also purposefully designed to cater for local situations that were in line with the aspiration of the emerging new States of the region. From inception, therefore, the School was compelled to embark on applied research out of necessity. It provided guidance to the government in the codification of customary law, integration of court systems and matters of constitution making.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during this epoch when the School established a Legal Research Center under the directorship of A. Sawyer. Unfortunately this center wound up its activities with Sawyer&rsquo;s departure from the School. Books and monograms that were produced during this epoch were geared at producing local material for teaching. They sought to find African examples to fit into the common law principles and concepts that had to be applicable in Tanganyika. Students were also involved in research activities. They published their findings in research journals, for example, in the Denning Law Journal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the whole of the first decade, the students&rsquo; Denning Law Society [(Now University of Dar-es-Salaam Law Society (UDLS)] sponsored field research projects/competitions annually in the areas of African customary law, Islamic law and offered prizes to students who excelled in research writings and essays. These were also published in the Society&rsquo;s Journal, first the Denning Law journal (later the University of Dar-es-Salaam Law Journal and today the Nyerere Law Journal).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For almost three decades now, the School has been offering a three-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) degree program. However, since October 1999, the duration of the LL.B program has been extended to four years as a result of the curriculum review undertaken by the School in August 1999 in Arusha. The School also offers Postgraduate Diploma in Law (PGDL) and Master of Laws (LL.M) degree programs. It has also been offering degrees in Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and certificate courses in law. At the eve of 50 years, the School of Law established another undergraduate degree course of Bachelor of Arts Legal Enforcement (BALE).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently the School is composed of three departments (Public Law, Private Law, and Economic Law). Apart from the three departments, the School interacts with the outside world through institutions that are based at the School. Today, the School houses the Center for the Study of Forced Migration (CSFM), the Legal Aid Committee (LAC) and the Tanzanian German Centre for Eastern African Legal Studies (TGCL). These provide opportunities for inter-departmental research at the School of law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The School, through TGCL, has the best collection of human rights, constitutional law and regional integration law material in the country. It also harbors an up to date library specialized in the Law of the Sea and International Environmental Law. This unit acts as springboards for inter-disciplinary research and outreach programs in these fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from teaching undergraduate, graduate students and coordinating courses in certificate of law, members of staff of the School perform research on various issues transcending social, economic and cultural boundaries but linked to the development of the jurisprudence of the law and legal systems.</p>\r\n', '<p>.</p>\r\n', '', NULL, '', '/#/background-of-school', '2017-11-13 07:57:33', 1, 16, '/#/'),

The programme was meant to provide scientific basis for the operation of the Government supervised Land Conservation Project in Dodoma (HADO). The Programme came to an end in 2000. During its lifetime the Programme produced 11 PhDs, 3 MSc and over 100 publications have been produced. During the reporting period, a three-day Workshop was held in Dodoma to feedback and solicit stakeholder inputs and reflect on the research output of the Programme. Workshop participants included senior representatives from Kondoa District and the Dodoma Regional Secretariat. Subsequently, the research works have been synthesized into a Monograph. A summary of the monograph has been produced in Kiswahili for dissemination to all key stakeholders including those in Kondoa District. Research Coordinator Dr. C.

The main objective of this project was to assess performance and effectiveness of Ngoro and Malonga farming systems in Matengo highlands in the conservation soil fertility and enhancement of crop productivity. The results show that ngoro farming practice has more positive impacts on poverty alleviation, environmental management and sustainable agriculture compared to malonga system. Ngoro system is more effective on prevention of soil erosion. On the other hand, cultivation along the hills using malonga practice leads to soil erosion reduces soil fertility and productivity. Non-farm income generating activities are associated with malongo farming systems and thus appear to be adopted as a strategy of reducing poverty. This farming system is associated with marginal environments where agriculture is not favourable. Researchers: Prof. P. Yanda Dr. A. Majule, and Dr. A.

The objectives of this project were two-fold: to document the existing resources use patterns and establish the interactions between human activities and resource use patterns in the highland and lowland areas and; to examine and assess the relationships between population growth and poverty levels.

The work has been done on advisory capacity within the global programme of Capacity 21. The programme under PO-RALG and UNDP has ended this year. The objective of the programme was to build capacity of the district staff, ward staff and communities to plan. This was done in eight wards and about forty villages. The PRA was used as a tool for communities to come up with their own village plans based on priorities of the felt needs. The communities had also to come up with implementation modalities. Contrary to the popular views, district staff are able to facilitate planning once they are empowered. Such an approach enhances commitment, ownership and sustainability. Researcher: Prof. I.

Among the lessons learned is that it has been noted that villagers in the study area are quite familiar with malaria and have developed a number of locally adapted control measures such as use of traditional herbs. Such adaptation does not exist for cholera because the disease is considered new and appropriate medication is yet to be found. Findings from this study will provide an understanding on the vulnerability, magnitude of impacts, locally derived adaptation strategies, and identify areas for external intervention measures.

The study further explores development problems facing the people through PRA, households survey and field visits. Through laboratory incubation, the potential of various organic residues in ameliorating soil acidity associated with sulphur dusting and effects on growth of maize are investigated. Findings from this study show that sulphur is still a major fungicide used in both zones and this poses a threat to the soil fertility. The adoption of alternative organic fungicides is still slow due to various reasons including poor institutional frameworks and dissemination.

The project operates in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania and seeks to address the following questions: What are the contributions of climate change and human impacts on tropical environments as reconstructed for Holocene (vegetation, water resources, soils, etc.) and; What are the consequences of environmental change on the livelihood of human societies? In order to address these key issues, routine data collection will be undertaken for reconstructing the past history of climate change so that we can predict the future. In light of this requirement, a monitoring station has been established at Masoko, Rungwe District. Currently, there is an ongoing data collection on temperature, rainfall, soil erosion and other socio-economic data on the surrounding environment. IRA Researchers: Dr. A. Majule, Prof. R.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the dynamics of the farming systems in Sukumaland. Specifically the study aims at examining the food security situation and poverty alleviation strategies by local communities under changing environments, with specific reference to the impact of small-scale mining activities on land degradation and the environment in general. At the villages detailed data collection was undertaken through discussions with key informants, participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) and field observations.

The study is undertaken in Mtwara Rural and Tandahimba, Mtwara Region. In each district participatory studies and field observations were undertaken. Preliminary findings indicate that a fairly large proportion of the population is dependent for their livelihoods on non-wood food forest products. Thus, the use of ming&#39;oko has increased and overexploitation has changed the availability and size of the product. Poverty alleviation in theses areas is constrained variably by several factors including lack of or poor water services, schools and other related infrastructure. Further, ecological characterization of different non-wood forest products needs to be undertaken in order to understand the impact of exploitation on the environment. Researchers: Dr. A.

The main objective of this project was to assess performance and effectiveness of Ngoro and Malonga farming systems in Matengo highlands in the conservation soil fertility and enhancement of crop productivity. The results show that ngoro farming practice has more positive impacts on poverty alleviation, environmental management and sustainable agriculture compared to malonga system. Ngoro system is more effective on prevention of soil erosion. On the other hand, cultivation along the hills using malonga practice leads to soil erosion reduces soil fertility and productivity. Non-farm income generating activities are associated with malongo farming systems and thus appear to be adopted as a strategy of reducing poverty. This farming system is associated with marginal environments where agriculture is not favourable. Researchers: Prof. P. Yanda Dr. A. Majule, and Dr. A.

While across the world, philosophy is a very active field of study and research, the UDSM has been one of few main national universities in the region that do not have a full philosophy programme.

(162, 'Short Courses', 'Short Courses', '<p>The Institute regularly organizes short courses. Most of these courses are tailor made targeting specific client needs. Short courses are provided in the following fields:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Environmental Impact Assessment -Geographical Information Systems</li>\r\n	<li>Communicating Environmental Research to Policy Makers</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental Economics and Valuation</li>\r\n	<li>Integration of Population Variables in Development Planning</li>\r\n	<li>Training on Communicating Environmental Research to Policy Makers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many scientific groups and environmental scientists agree that aspects of a population&#39;s growth, composition, and distribution can lead to environmental changes that affect human and ecosystem health. Audiences influential in setting national policy agendas, such as the media and government officials, often inadequately reflect those linkages in their reports and policy decisions. Yet every year valuable human and financial resources are spent to produce environment research results that fail to reach policymakers and, consequently, are not used to shape policies and programs. The Institute of Resource Assessment (University of Dar es Salaam) in collaboration with the Population Reference Bureau (USA) organizes intensive workshops that help bridge the gap between researchers and policymakers. Sessions help participants understand how to better communicate the population and health components of environmental research, identify the policy and program implications of survey data and research studies, understand how research can influence the policy process, and communicate research findings in simple and compelling formats. The objective of this workshop is to learn how to maximize policymakers&#39; and planners&#39; use of research results that illustrate the interaction of population, health and environment variables. Specifically, participants will learn how to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Address problems policymakers face with integrated research</li>\r\n	<li>Understand how research findings enter and influence the policy process</li>\r\n	<li>Develop a policy-level communication strategy and action plan</li>\r\n	<li>Design a media strategy, write press releases and give interviews to journalists</li>\r\n	<li>Prepare and present short policy documents such as policy memoranda and fact sheets</li>\r\n	<li>Create and deliver oral policy presentations using a computer-based graphics program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The workshops are designed for researchers, program managers, and others responsible for formulating and implementing environmental programs. Participants should have a strong background in research and data analysis as well as experience with computers. The workshop consists of a combination of plenary and small working-group sessions, emphasizing a hands-on, participatory approach. Sessions cover six areas, each with a corresponding output:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Exploring population-health-environment integration</li>\r\n	<li>Exploring the research-to-policy gap and designing policy-relevant research</li>\r\n	<li>Developing strategies for the communication of research results</li>\r\n	<li>Communicating research results through the media</li>\r\n	<li>Preparing policy documents and briefings</li>\r\n	<li>Making oral presentations using computer graphic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', '<p>The Institute regularly organizes short courses. Most of these courses are tailor made targeting specific client needs. Short courses are provided in the following fields:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Environmental Impact Assessment -Geographical Information Systems</li>\r\n	<li>Communicating Environmental Research to Policy Makers</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental Economics and Valuation</li>\r\n	<li>Integration of Population Variables in Development Planning</li>\r\n	<li>Training on Communicating Environmental Research to Policy Makers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many scientific groups and environmental scientists agree that aspects of a population&#39;s growth, composition, and distribution can lead to environmental changes that affect human and ecosystem health. Audiences influential in setting national policy agendas, such as the media and government officials, often inadequately reflect those linkages in their reports and policy decisions. Yet every year valuable human and financial resources are spent to produce environment research results that fail to reach policymakers and, consequently, are not used to shape policies and programs. The Institute of Resource Assessment (University of Dar es Salaam) in collaboration with the Population Reference Bureau (USA) organizes intensive workshops that help bridge the gap between researchers and policymakers. Sessions help participants understand how to better communicate the population and health components of environmental research, identify the policy and program implications of survey data and research studies, understand how research can influence the policy process, and communicate research findings in simple and compelling formats.

Other readers may be allowed at the Director&#39;s discretion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Publications</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before official publications are catalogued they are shelved together and arranged under names of countries. Because catalogued works are shelved with other classified sequences of books, pamphlets, and periodicals, and because some are on film it is necessary to consult the library catalogues and the register for official publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>United Nations Documents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>United Nations (U.N.) documents consist of those issued by the main U.N. body such as the General Assembly, Security Council, Regional Commissions, as well as those issued by various U.N. agencies, including UNESCO, UNCTAD, WHO, UNEP, FAO, UNIDO, ILO, and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some U.N. publications are located in the East Africana Collection while others have been integrated into other collections. Publications in East Africana are kept together in the main, and are filed by their own publication numbers and not according to the library classification system used for other materials. The key to the library&#39;s holdings is the register of United Nations Documents kept in the workroom of the East Africana Section. Access to the documents is by the various United Nations Documents Indexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Maps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most maps received are East African maps from various Government Survey Departments and are located in the East Africana Collection. Atlases and gazetteer are located in the Reference section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Theses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collection contains theses documents from the former sister colleges of the University of East Africa. Currently, more than 2,158 theses titles have been microfilmed, jacketed and are on microfiche. However,more than 2,406 titles have been microfilmed and jacketed but are yet to be labeled, typed and microfiche. Many more theses titles have been abstracted and compiled in the Database of African Theses and Dissertations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manuscripts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection holds Corry, Kiswahili and Arabic manuscripts. Over &nbsp;1180 titles of manuscripts have been microfilmed and out of these, 291 titles for Corry papers have also been microfiche. The rest, that is Kiswahili and Arabic manuscripts are yet to be labeled, typed and microfiche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Liberation movement Materials</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collection also holds the materials on Liberation Movements in Africa.</p>\r\n', NULL, NULL, '', '/institutes/library/east-africana-collection', '2017-11-24 10:35:00', 1, 31, NULL),

(246, 'Library Guide', 'Library Guide', '<p>The Library is an Institute that every student is likely to visit frequently and regularly. It is a place for study, providing book and non book materials, which supplement lectures and the quietness which serious students need. It is a service common to all, and is generous in its borrowing facilities and in its opening hours. It is essential that users of the library should contribute to its satisfactory operation by observing the regulations, which govern its use with particular regard to borrowing books in the legitimate way. The rules are meant to ensure equal access to all library resources and facilities. Library staff will check all items being taken out of the library. It is for the benefit of all readers that this checking is done in order to avoid the inconvenience, which may arise when books intended for use by all are unlawfully removed. Readers are therefore asked to co-operate with the library staff and security guards at both the entrance and exit controls.<br />\r\nThe library is largely an open access. This means that readers have free access to the shelves and may browse and borrow at will. Certain categories of materials may not be borrowed, mainly because of their value, or rarity, or the great use made of them. These are mainly placed either in the special or shelf reserve of respective collections. Meanwhile, the East Africana collection is accessible only to research students and staff, others may use it only with permission from the Library Director or authorized senior library staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Registration and Borrowing</strong><br />\r\nTo join the library, fill in a registration card at the issue desk. First year students must complete their Orientation Week Library assignment before getting their unique identification numbers. Continuing students must re-register each new academic year. Students who have not cleared all their previous loans of books or fines will not be allowed to re-register and borrow any library materials. To borrow, present the item you want at the circulation desk together with your bar coded identity card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Catalogues</strong><br />\r\nThere are two main catalogues:<br />\r\n1. The manual card catalogue<br />\r\n2. The online public access catalogue (OPAC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The manual card catalogue:</strong><br />\r\nThe manual card catalogue is located at the main entrance hall on the first floor. It consists of two separate catalogues one for author and the other for subject. Users are cautioned that all materials acquired after November 1998 are not reflected in the manual card catalogues. They are therefore advised to search the computerized catalogue (OPAC) for a more comprehensive and current search. Retrospective conversion of the manual library catalogue has been completed.<br />\r\nThe manual catalogue is divided into two separate catalogues;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. The author catalogue<br />\r\nb. The subject catalogue and subsidiary catalogues</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Author Catalogue</strong><br />\r\nThis is an alphabetical index on 5&quot; x 3&quot; cards, the cards showing the kind of materials the Library has by individuals, societies, official bodies etc. Most of the materials are monographs and are entered under the surname of the author of each monograph. If there is no author, the entry is under title. Works by institutions and societies are entered under their names, except official organizations, which are usually entered first under the country from which they emanate, followed by the name of the organization. Periodicals are entered under their titles or under the names of the organisations which issue them, as in the case of proceedings, transactions and reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Subject Catalogue</strong><br />\r\nThis is an alphabetical index on 5&quot; x 3&quot; cards, being arranged by subject headings which show the subject contents of the books. The catalogue contains many cross-references from synonymous subject headings, which are not used, to the headings, which are used. If a book deals with three separate subjects a subject card will be filed in the catalogue for each of them. The book, however, will be shelved with the subject with which it mainly deals. The subject catalogue, therefore, is a more exhaustive guide to the subject with which it mainly deals and subject content of the library than is the classified shelf arrangement of books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Special Catalogue</strong><br />\r\nThe Library maintains the following extra catalogues.<br />\r\n(a) The Law collection catalogue which holds, author and subject catalogues. This is a duplicate of entries for law books in the main catalogues. It is kept in the Law Collection.<br />\r\n(b) The East Africana Collection has both author and subject catalogues for each work shelved in the collection<br />\r\n(c) Maps collection author catalogue has a main author card for each work shelved in the collection. It is kept with the map collection.<br />\r\n(d) Manuscript collection author catalogue, has a main author or title entry for each item catalogued by the library, though not necessarily kept in the manuscript cabinets. The catalogue is kept in the East Africana collection.<br />\r\n(e) The catalogue of Cory manuscripts is also kept in the East Africana Collection.<br />\r\n(f) The library files card bibliographies of current writings on Africa. These are compiled by other libraries and organizations such as Afro-Asian Studies Group Library, Cambridge University and Centre International de Documentatio Economique et Social Africaine (C.I.D.E.S.A) Bibliographic index cards for publication relating to African economic and Social matters.<br />\r\n(g) The periodicals index, lists alphabetically all periodical titles held by the library. Both the author and subject cards in the main catalogues and their duplicates in the special collections (Law, East Africana) have other information such as date, place of publication and where the materials are located in the library (see example below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC):</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a new computerized library catalogue that has been developed using the ADLIB integrated library software package. The library online catalogue is a union catalogue that integrates catalogue records of faculty, institute and departmental libraries on the campus. The process of integrating these records is on going and currently the resources of the Faculty of Law (FOL) Library, the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), Demographic Training Unit (DTU), Faculty of Commerce and Management, Faculty of Education, Institute of Mass Media and Journalism, Faculty of Aquatic Sciences and Technology and Institute of Kiswahili Research (IKR) have been fully integrated. Departmental Libraries in the Prospective College of Engineering, faculties of Arts and Social Sciences, Science, have been partially integrated into the Union Catalogue. The computerized catalogue is accessible through the Internet at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or world wide web address; www.libis.udsm.ac.tz/adlib/beginner/index_gb.html .This catalogue can be accessed and searched at any computer that has been connected to the Internet using the ADLIB Internet server search system. Within the library there are a total of 14 computer terminals at different service points to facilitate searching the online catalogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe University of Dar es Salaam Library OPAC is user friendly. Users can conduct a simple search or an expert search system using boolean operators. Users have the option of searching the full catalogue or parts of the catalogue such as books, articles, audio visual materials and serials. Users can search by title, author, organization, text search, subject or even by year of publication. Search result gives information on the title of the book, author, publication statement, and the section of the library or where the item is located.

Washington, D.C. It divided the field of knowledge as follows:<br />\r\nClasses A-Z<br />\r\nA General Works<br />\r\nB Philosophy, psychology, religion<br />\r\nC History, auxiliary sciences: chronology, numismatic, heraldry, biography<br />\r\nD History: general and old world; Africa<br />\r\nE-F History: America<br />\r\nG Geography, anthropology, folklore<br />\r\nH Social science: statistics, economics, sociology<br />\r\nJ Political science, constitutional history, international law<br />\r\nK Law<br />\r\nL Education<br />\r\nM Music<br />\r\nN Fine Arts<br />\r\nP Language and Literature<br />\r\nQ Science<br />\r\nR Medicine<br />\r\nS Agriculture<br />\r\nT Technology<br />\r\nU Military Science<br />\r\nV Naval Science<br />\r\nZ Bibliography, Librarianship</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subjects are separated from each other and are subdivided into even smaller and more specialized aspects by a process of dividing the classification numbers: e.g.<br />\r\nA-Z Main class<br />\r\nAE-AZ Narrower classes of subjects<br />\r\nABI-999 (numerical) Detailed division of subject<br />\r\nAB100.1.A2 (decimal) Author arrangement (e.g.Abraham) under a class number.<br />\r\nThe classification number is typed in the left margin of the catalogue and is written on the spine of the book.<br />\r\nLocation symbols are used and prefixed to the classification numbers for works which are kept separate from the main book stock as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Main Library</strong><br />\r\nBIOD Biodiversity database<br />\r\nEAF East Africana<br />\r\nEAF.CORY Cory manuscirpts<br />\r\nEDB Environment database<br />\r\nFol Folio<br />\r\nFOL Faculty of Law<br />\r\nFOS Fosbrooke<br />\r\nIDS Institute of Development Studies<br />\r\nLAW Law collection<br />\r\nEAF.LIB Liberation Movements, African<br />\r\nMAP Maps<br />\r\nMEE Microfiches<br />\r\nMIC Microcards<br />\r\nMIF Microfilms<br />\r\nMSS Manuscripts<br />\r\nPAM Pamphlets<br />\r\nPER Periodicals<br />\r\nQTO Quarto<br />\r\nREF References collection<br />\r\nREP Reprint<br />\r\nTHS Thesis<br />\r\nUNO United Nations Collection<br />\r\nOther Libraries<br />\r\nAGR Sokoine University of Agriculture, Morogoro (SUA)<br />\r\nAGR/FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) Publications in SUA<br />\r\nAGR/SPE (Special Collection) in SUA<br />\r\nMED Medical Library Muhimbili<br />\r\nMED/WHO (World Health Organization) Publication<br />\r\nMUS National Museum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There can be a combination of location symbols, e.g. EAF.REP indicating a reprint in the East Africana collection, or LAW.QTO indicating a quarto size book in the Law collection, EAF.THS refers to thesis in East Africana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>THE FILING OF CATALOGUE CARDS</strong><br />\r\nIt is not easy to reduce thousands of catalogue entries to a simple alphabetical sequence, and unless one acquaints oneself with the basic filing rules one is bound to experience difficulty in using the catalogues and to overlook entries. Readers are advised to consult the outline of filing rules followed by the library, which is available near the catalogues.<br />\r\nIt will help if one knows the main rules, which are briefly given below,<br />\r\n(a) The arrangement is word by word, alphabetized letter by letter to the end of each words:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Amsterdam</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newark</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b) In the author catalogue there could be three sequence under the same name, and in this order:<br />\r\nPersonal surname Moshi, Elibariki John<br />\r\nPlace as authors Moshi, Town Council<br />\r\nTitles, series, phrases Moshi magazine<br />\r\n(c) In the subject catalogue there could be four sequences under the same name, and in this order:<br />\r\nPersonal or other names READING, GEOFFREY<br />\r\nPlaces as authors READING, ENGLISH<br />\r\nSubjects, things READING<br />\r\nPhrases READING GOAL<br />\r\nA subject might be further divided and arranged according to the following rule:<br />\r\nSubject alone &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&hellip;.ART<br />\r\nSubject with form of subject division&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;....&hellip;ART-BIBL.<br />\r\nTime division&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;...ART-20th CENTURY.<br />\r\nGeographic division&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;....

Note that there are three sequences, determined according to the heights of the books:<br />\r\na. Octavos ( the bulk of the stock up to 27 cm (11&quot;) high<br />\r\nb. Quartos, over 27 cm (11&quot;) and up to 33 cm. (13&quot;) with the location symbol QTO<br />\r\nc. Folio over 33cm. (13&quot;) with the location symbol FOL</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(2) Reference Collection</strong><br />\r\nThis collection consists of major reference books such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, yearbooks and handbooks as well as directories and University calendars. Reference books have the location symbol REF. Materials in the Reference Collection may be read only in the reading area near this collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(3) Newspaper Facility</strong><br />\r\nThe Library buys a number of current Tanzanian daily and weekly newspapers for use by readers in the newly established Newspaper area. Only current issues are available here: back issues are available in the East Africana Section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(4) Microfilms and other microforms</strong><br />\r\nMicrofilms, micro-cards and other forms of micro reproduction are kept in the Reference section and may be borrowed on request, for use on the reading machines in this Department. Content lists on the films, which contain many different works or series, are kept at the Reference Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(5) CD-ROMs</strong><br />\r\nCD-ROM (Computer Disc Read Only Memory) is a media for storage and retrieval of information. As the name implies, they are compact discs capable of storing large sets of data, which can be accessed and read using a computer terminal with a CD-ROM disc drive.<br />\r\nThe library holds a number of international bibliographic databases on CD-ROMS. The discs and the computers are located in the Reference section. They may be used on request and with the consultation of the Reference section staff. All faculty, postgraduates and undergraduates are entitled to use the CD-ROM service. There is a user fee for external users of this service. For a list of CD ROMs in the library consult the Guide to CD-ROM databases in the Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(6) The East Africana Collection</strong><br />\r\nThe collection of East Africana items is purely for reference. It is a research collection containing items of East Africa generally, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with emphasis on Tanzania.<br />\r\nThe items consist of books, pamphlets, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, theses and reprints. Many of these include publications of the East African Universities and official documents. Naturally the greater part of the collection consists of items on Tanzania including those received on legal deposit. However, there is a fair coverage of the other East African countries particularly in statistical and periodical materials published prior to the mid 1980&rsquo;s. The Cory, Kiswahili and Arabic manuscripts are the most significant ones.<br />\r\nEvery reader entering the collection should identify him/herself and register in the counter book at the checkpoint. Only six loose sheets of paper may be taken into the room by those entitled to use the Collection. Only academic staff, postgraduates, final year undergraduates and researches with research clearance are entitled to use it. Other readers may be allowed in at the Director&rsquo;s discretion after satisfying him/her on the need to use the collection through letters of introduction or request from their Heads of Department or Institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(7) Government Publications</strong><br />\r\nBefore official publications are catalogued they are shelved together and arranged under names of countries. Because catalogued works are shelved with other classified sequences of books, pamphlets, and periodicals, and because some are on film it is necessary to consult the library catalogues and the register for official publications in order to know with certainty what is in stock. The uncatalogued official publications are located in the East Africana Section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(8) United Nations Documents</strong><br />\r\nUnited Nations (U.N.) documents consist of those issued by the main U.N. body such as the General Assembly, Security Council, Regional Commissions, as well as those issued by various U.N. agencies, including UNESCO, UNCTAD, WHO, UNEP, FAO, UNIDO, ILO, etc.<br />\r\nSome U.N. publications are located in the East Africana Collection while others have been integrated into other various collections such as Law and Reference where they may be accessed in the normal way. Publications still in East Africana are kept together in the main, and are filed by their own publication numbers and not according to the library classification system used for other materials. The key to the library&rsquo;s holdings is the register of United Nations Documents kept in the workroom of the East Africana Section. Access to the documents is by the various United Nations Documents Indexes to which reference should be made</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(9) Maps</strong><br />\r\nMost maps received are East African maps from various Government Survey Departments and are located in the East Africana Collection. Atlases and gazetteers are located in the Reference Section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(10). Theses</strong><br />\r\nThe University Library is a depository of all unpublished theses from the University and from other universities written by Tanzanians. The theses collection also contains theses from Makerere and Nairobi Universities acquired through theses exchange program by the three former sister Colleges of The University of East Africa. However, this arrangement has not been fulfilled fully, and there are some gaps. All theses are located in the East Africana Collection and are shelved separately, bearing the prefix THS.EAF. Undergraduate dissertations by students are also located in the East Africana Collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(11) Manuscripts</strong><br />\r\nThe East Africana Collection holds Cory, Kiswahili and Arabic Manuscripts</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(12) Liberation Movement Materials</strong><br />\r\nThe East Africana Collection holds limited materials on Liberation Movements in Africa</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(13) Law</strong><br />\r\nThe Law Collection is self-contained, having within the same area books, periodicals and government publications pertaining to law and legal matters. It has also separate (and full) author and subject catalogues of its holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(14). Science and Engineering</strong><br />\r\nAll library materials related to Science and technology are shelved separately at Science &amp; Engineering Department which is located at the 1st floor of library building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(13) Arts and Social Sciences</strong><br />\r\nArts &amp; Social Science materials are available on the 2nd floor of Library building under Department of Arts &amp; Social Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>(14) Pamphlets</strong><br />\r\nPamphlets are shelved separately at the end of the book sequences. An exception on this arrangement is made in the case of pamphlets in the Bibliography section of class Z, which are interfiled with the books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '<p>The Library is an Institute that every student is likely to visit frequently and regularly. It is a place for study, providing book and non book materials, which supplement lectures and the quietness which serious students need. It is a service common to all, and is generous in its borrowing facilities and in its opening hours. It is essential that users of the library should contribute to its satisfactory operation by observing the regulations, which govern its use with particular regard to borrowing books in the legitimate way. The rules are meant to ensure equal access to all library resources and facilities. Library staff will check all items being taken out of the library. It is for the benefit of all readers that this checking is done in order to avoid the inconvenience, which may arise when books intended for use by all are unlawfully removed. Readers are therefore asked to co-operate with the library staff and security guards at both the entrance and exit controls.<br />\r\nThe library is largely an open access. This means that readers have free access to the shelves and may browse and borrow at will. Certain categories of materials may not be borrowed, mainly because of their value, or rarity, or the great use made of them. These are mainly placed either in the special or shelf reserve of respective collections. Meanwhile, the East Africana collection is accessible only to research students and staff, others may use it only with permission from the Library Director or authorized senior library staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Registration and Borrowing</strong><br />\r\nTo join the library, fill in a registration card at the issue desk. First year students must complete their Orientation Week Library assignment before getting their unique identification numbers. Continuing students must re-register each new academic year. Students who have not cleared all their previous loans of books or fines will not be allowed to re-register and borrow any library materials. To borrow, present the item you want at the circulation desk together with your bar coded identity card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Catalogues</strong><br />\r\nThere are two main catalogues:<br />\r\n1. The manual card catalogue<br />\r\n2. The online public access catalogue (OPAC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The manual card catalogue:</strong><br />\r\nThe manual card catalogue is located at the main entrance hall on the first floor. It consists of two separate catalogues one for author and the other for subject. Users are cautioned that all materials acquired after November 1998 are not reflected in the manual card catalogues. They are therefore advised to search the computerized catalogue (OPAC) for a more comprehensive and current search. Retrospective conversion of the manual library catalogue has been completed.<br />\r\nThe manual catalogue is divided into two separate catalogues;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. The author catalogue<br />\r\nb. The subject catalogue and subsidiary catalogues</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Author Catalogue</strong><br />\r\nThis is an alphabetical index on 5&quot; x 3&quot; cards, the cards showing the kind of materials the Library has by individuals, societies, official bodies etc. Most of the materials are monographs and are entered under the surname of the author of each monograph. If there is no author, the entry is under title. Works by institutions and societies are entered under their names, except official organizations, which are usually entered first under the country from which they emanate, followed by the name of the organization. Periodicals are entered under their titles or under the names of the organisations which issue them, as in the case of proceedings, transactions and reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Subject Catalogue</strong><br />\r\nThis is an alphabetical index on 5&quot; x 3&quot; cards, being arranged by subject headings which show the subject contents of the books. The catalogue contains many cross-references from synonymous subject headings, which are not used, to the headings, which are used. If a book deals with three separate subjects a subject card will be filed in the catalogue for each of them. The book, however, will be shelved with the subject with which it mainly deals. The subject catalogue, therefore, is a more exhaustive guide to the subject with which it mainly deals and subject content of the library than is the classified shelf arrangement of books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Special Catalogue</strong><br />\r\nThe Library maintains the following extra catalogues.<br />\r\n(a) The Law collection catalogue which holds, author and subject catalogues. This is a duplicate of entries for law books in the main catalogues. It is kept in the Law Collection.<br />\r\n(b) The East Africana Collection has both author and subject catalogues for each work shelved in the collection<br />\r\n(c) Maps collection author catalogue has a main author card for each work shelved in the collection. It is kept with the map collection.<br />\r\n(d) Manuscript collection author catalogue, has a main author or title entry for each item catalogued by the library, though not necessarily kept in the manuscript cabinets. The catalogue is kept in the East Africana collection.<br />\r\n(e) The catalogue of Cory manuscripts is also kept in the East Africana Collection.<br />\r\n(f) The library files card bibliographies of current writings on Africa. These are compiled by other libraries and organizations such as Afro-Asian Studies Group Library, Cambridge University and Centre International de Documentatio Economique et Social Africaine (C.I.D.E.S.A) Bibliographic index cards for publication relating to African economic and Social matters.<br />\r\n(g) The periodicals index, lists alphabetically all periodical titles held by the library. Both the author and subject cards in the main catalogues and their duplicates in the special collections (Law, East Africana) have other information such as date, place of publication and where the materials are located in the library (see example below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC):</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a new computerized library catalogue that has been developed using the ADLIB integrated library software package. The library online catalogue is a union catalogue that integrates catalogue records of faculty, institute and departmental libraries on the campus. The process of integrating these records is on going and currently the resources of the Faculty of Law (FOL) Library, the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), Demographic Training Unit (DTU), Faculty of Commerce and Management, Faculty of Education, Institute of Mass Media and Journalism, Faculty of Aquatic Sciences and Technology and Institute of Kiswahili Research (IKR) have been fully integrated. Departmental Libraries in the Prospective College of Engineering, faculties of Arts and Social Sciences, Science, have been partially integrated into the Union Catalogue. The computerized catalogue is accessible through the Internet at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or world wide web address; www.libis.udsm.ac.tz/adlib/beginner/index_gb.html .This catalogue can be accessed and searched at any computer that has been connected to the Internet using the ADLIB Internet server search system. Within the library there are a total of 14 computer terminals at different service points to facilitate searching the online catalogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe University of Dar es Salaam Library OPAC is user friendly. Users can conduct a simple search or an expert search system using boolean operators. Users have the option of searching the full catalogue or parts of the catalogue such as books, articles, audio visual materials and serials. Users can search by title, author, organization, text search, subject or even by year of publication. Search result gives information on the title of the book, author, publication statement, and the section of the library or where the item is located. Other information include the class mark, availability status and whether the item can be borrowed or not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CLASSIFICATION</strong><br />\r\nThe Library uses the classification schedule devised and used by the Library of Congress.

(265, '	Welcome Note', 'Dawati la Mkurugenzi ', '<p>Taasisi ya Taaluma za Kiswahili ( TATAKI) ya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam ni asasi kongwe inayojishughulisha na ufundishaji, utafiti na utoajiushauri wa kitaaluma katika maendeleo ya lugha ya Kiswahili. TATAKI inadhamana ya kufundisha na kutafiti vipengele vyote vya lugha, kwa kuzigatia vipaumbele vya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es salaam na Jamhuri ya muungano wa Tanzania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HISTORIA YA TATAKI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TATAKI ni Taasisi yenye historia ndefu kuliko Taasisi zote zinazohusika na ukuzaji na uendelezaji wa lugha ya Kiswahili duniani. Historia ya TATAKI inaanzia mwaka 1930 ilipoanzishwa kamati ya lugha (ya Kiswahili) ya Afrika Mashariki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mnamo mwaka 1961 Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam kilianzishwa kama Chuo Kikuu Kishiriki cha London. Kuanzia mwaka 1962, viongozi wa kamati waliaza kufikiria kuhamisha shughuli za kamati kwenye Chuo Kikuu kimojawapo. Vyuo vilivyofikiriwa ni Makerere na Dar es Salaam. Mwaka 1963 shughuli za kamati zilihamishiwa katika Chuo Kikuu Kishiriki cha Dar es Salaam na hatimye kamati ilibadili jina na kuwa Chuo cha Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili. Majukumu ya Chuo cha Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili hayakutofautiana na yale ya kamati ya lugha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mwaka 1970 baada ya kuanzishwa Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam ndipo Taasisi ya uchunguzi wa Kiswahili (TUKI) ikaanzishwa chini ya ibara ya 22(3) ya sheria ya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam. Katika kipindi hiki ilianzishwa pia idara ya Kiswahili ya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam iliyokuwa chini ya Kitivo cha Sanaa na Sayansi za Jamii. Miongoni mwa majukumu ya idara ilikuwa ni kufundisha lugha ya Kiswahili kwa wanafunzi kutoka ndani na nje ya Tanzania. Kuanzia mwanzoni mwa miaka 2000, Chuo Kikuu kilianza kupitia upya muundo wake ili kufanyakazi kwa ufanisi na weledi. Katika mchakato huo yalitolewa mapendekezo mbalimbali ilikiwa ni pamoja na kuunganisha vitengo ambavyo majukumu yake yalionekana kufanana. Kwa kuwa malengo ya idara ya Kiswahili na TUKI yalilenga kukuza na kuendeleza lugha ya Kiswahili, mnamo mwaka 2009 iliyokuwa idara ya Kiswahili ikaungana na TUKI na kuunda Taasisi ya Taaluma za Kiswahili (TATAKI). Majukumu ya TATAKI sasa yamejikita katika utafiti wa Nyanja mbalimbali zihusuzo lugha na fasihi ya Kiswahili katika ngazi mbalimbali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TATAKI inaidara mbili ambazo ni idara ya lugha ya Kiswahili na isimu na idara ya fasihi, mawasiliano na uchapaji.

Hata hivyo ili mwombaji adahiliwe katika programu ya B.A (kiswahili) anapaswa, pamoja na masomo mengine, awe amesoma somo la Kiswahili kidato cha tano na sita na kufaulu kwa wastani wa angalau alama D au awe na sifa zinazofanana na hizo.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>M.A. Kiswahili</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Hii ni shahada ua umahiri ambayo hutolewa kwa Tamrini na Tasnifu katika Isimu na Fasihi kwa muda wa miezi 18 (Tamrini na Tasnifu); na miezi 24 (kwa Tasnifu pekee). Ili kujiunga na programu hii mbali na sifa za jumla za Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam, mwombaji anapaswa kuwa amefaulu masomo ya Kiswahili katika shahada za awali kwa WAKIA (GPA) isiyopungua 3.0 kwa kozi za Kiswahili.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>PhD.

TATAKI inadhamana ya kufundisha na kutafiti vipengele vyote vya lugha, kwa kuzigatia vipaumbele vya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es salaam na Jamhuri ya muungano wa Tanzania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HISTORIA YA TATAKI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>TATAKI ni Taasisi yenye historia ndefu kuliko Taasisi zote zinazohusika na ukuzaji na uendelezaji wa lugha ya Kiswahili duniani. Historia ya TATAKI inaanzia mwaka 1930 ilipoanzishwa kamati ya lugha (ya Kiswahili) ya Afrika Mashariki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mnamo mwaka 1961 Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam kilianzishwa kama Chuo Kikuu Kishiriki cha London. Kuanzia mwaka 1962, viongozi wa kamati waliaza kufikiria kuhamisha shughuli za kamati kwenye Chuo Kikuu kimojawapo. Vyuo vilivyofikiriwa ni Makerere na Dar es Salaam. Mwaka 1963 shughuli za kamati zilihamishiwa katika Chuo Kikuu Kishiriki cha Dar es Salaam na hatimye kamati ilibadili jina na kuwa Chuo cha Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili. Majukumu ya Chuo cha Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili hayakutofautiana na yale ya kamati ya lugha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mwaka 1970 baada ya kuanzishwa Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam ndipo Taasisi ya uchunguzi wa Kiswahili (TUKI) ikaanzishwa chini ya ibara ya 22(3) ya sheria ya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam. Katika kipindi hiki ilianzishwa pia idara ya Kiswahili ya Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam iliyokuwa chini ya Kitivo cha Sanaa na Sayansi za Jamii. Miongoni mwa majukumu ya idara ilikuwa ni kufundisha lugha ya Kiswahili kwa wanafunzi kutoka ndani na nje ya Tanzania. Kuanzia mwanzoni mwa miaka 2000, Chuo Kikuu kilianza kupitia upya muundo wake ili kufanyakazi kwa ufanisi na weledi. Katika mchakato huo yalitolewa mapendekezo mbalimbali ilikiwa ni pamoja na kuunganisha vitengo ambavyo majukumu yake yalionekana kufanana. Kwa kuwa malengo ya idara ya Kiswahili na TUKI yalilenga kukuza na kuendeleza lugha ya Kiswahili, mnamo mwaka 2009 iliyokuwa idara ya Kiswahili ikaungana na TUKI na kuunda Taasisi ya Taaluma za Kiswahili (TATAKI). Majukumu ya TATAKI sasa yamejikita katika utafiti wa Nyanja mbalimbali zihusuzo lugha na fasihi ya Kiswahili katika ngazi mbalimbali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TATAKI inaidara mbili ambazo ni idara ya lugha ya Kiswahili na isimu na idara ya fasihi, mawasiliano na uchapaji. Idara hizi kwa pamoja zinashirikiana katika ufundishaji wa programu mbalimbali taasisini kama inavyoainishwa hapa chini:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PROGRAMU ZINAZOFUNDISHWA NA TATAKI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>B.A. Kiswahili</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Ni shahada ya awali ambayo hutolewa katika muda wa miaka mitatu. Katika shahada hii, kozi mbalimbali za Isimu na Fasihi hutolewa. Masharti ya jumla ya udahili ya Chuo Kikuu huzingatiwa. Hata hivyo ili mwombaji adahiliwe katika programu ya B.A (kiswahili) anapaswa, pamoja na masomo mengine, awe amesoma somo la Kiswahili kidato cha tano na sita na kufaulu kwa wastani wa angalau alama D au awe na sifa zinazofanana na hizo.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>M.A. Kiswahili</em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Hii ni shahada ua umahiri ambayo hutolewa kwa Tamrini na Tasnifu katika Isimu na Fasihi kwa muda wa miezi 18 (Tamrini na Tasnifu); na miezi 24 (kwa Tasnifu pekee). Ili kujiunga na programu hii mbali na sifa za jumla za Chuo Kikuu cha Dar es Salaam, mwombaji anapaswa kuwa amefaulu masomo ya Kiswahili katika shahada za awali kwa WAKIA (GPA) isiyopungua 3.0 kwa kozi za Kiswahili.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong><em>PhD. Kiswahili </em></strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Masomo katika programu hii hutolewa kwa namna mbili. PhD kwa Tamrini na Tasnifu.PhD kwa Tamrini hutolewa kwa muda wa miaka minne na PhD kwa Tasnifu hutolewa kwa muda wa miaka mitatu. Ilikudahiliwa katika programu hizi mwombaji anapaswa kuwa amesoma Kiswahili au masomo yanayoendana na umahiri. Lugha inayotumika kufundishia na kuandika ripoti ya utafiti kwa programu zote ni Kiswahili.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VITUO VYA TATAKI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mbali na idara za ufundishaji, TATAKI pia hufanya kazi za kiutafiti kupitia vituo vya utafiti na ushauri.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>&nbsp; KITUO CHA FASIHI YA KISWAHILI NA MAPOKEO YA SIMULIZI YA KIAFRIKA </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miongoni mwa majukumu ya kituo hiki ni kuratibu na kusimamia shughuli zote za utafiti katika nyanja mbalimbali; kuandaa na kuchapisha Makala na vitabu vyo kufundishia kozi za fasihi, mawasiliano na uchapishaji kwa Kiswahili; kutafiti kuhusu kazi za wanafasihi mbalimbali wa zamani na sasa; kukusanya na kuhifadhi data, nyaraka na taarifu muhimuza kifasihi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>KITUO CHA ISTILAHI, TAFSIRI, UKALIMANI NA TEKNOLOJIA YA LUGHA</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jukumu kuu la kituo hiki ni kutoa huduma zinazohusu masuala ya istilahi, tafsiri, ukalimani na teknolojia ya lugha.

The fee is expected to cover for Internet services, Electricity, Office and Lab space, as well as other Institutes’ administrative costs.  Costs for the use of high tech lab facilities and their related reagents are charged separately. Other services such as fax, international calls, photocopy etc. are charged according to the actual usage.\r\n\r\nLABORATORIES AND THEIR USE\r\n\r\nAll IMS laboratories have specific regulations and guidelines. The regulations and guidelines depend on the type of activity conducted in a specific laboratory. Before engaging yourself to a specific laboratory, it is your responsibility to ensure that you know the regulations of the laboratory you are working at.\r\nFurthermore, as most of the laboratories and facilities experience high demand, you need to ensure that your planned activity is approved by the Superintendent of Laboratories prior to commencement.  For those visiting scientists intending to dive during their visit, they are advised to bring their own diving gears such as regulators, BCDs, masks, snorkels, fins, diving boots and wet suits as IMS has very limited stock of diving gears and there are plenty of users. However, IMS may be able to provide tanks and dive weights.\r\nIn the event of an equipment breakdown, or if you use the last bit of a particular chemical, it is your responsibility to report this immediately to the technician in-charge or head of the Superintendent of the laboratories.  Failure to do so may result in refusal for you to use IMS equipment and/or other resources.\r\nObviously it pays to be courteous to your fellow researchers, so please take think about others working (ongoing experiments) around you, or other people who may wish to use the same laboratory resources.\r\nPlease note that it is not allowed to keep wet clothes in the visiting scientists’ room or any other place in the laboratories.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORT\r\n\r\nThe Institute does not provide field transport. However, it may assist in getting the service from car renters.\r\n\r\nBOATS:\r\nThe Institute owns a boat, which can be hired (in case it is not engaged by other research activities) at a nominal fee, which is usually 10% lower than the market price. Below are the current charges in Tanzanian Shillings for hiring a boat outside the Institute.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the charges may fluctuate with season. Should you wish to use one of the Institute’s boats then you have two options: Either\r\n(a) You provide the fuel, pay the assistants and pay 20% of the market price; or\r\n(b) You pay 90% of the market price and be provided with fuel and boatman.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you will be requested to deposit some money with the Institute’s Accountants’ office.\r\n\r\nDestination 	Cost in TZS\r\nChumbe 	120,000\r\nBawe 	80,000\r\nChanguu 	70,000\r\nChapwani 	80,000\r\nMorogo 	80,000\r\nNyange 	90,000\r\nPange 	80,000\r\nPwakuu 	90,000\r\n\r\nWORK SCHEDULE\r\n\r\nYou are required to provide a work plan to the Associate Director (through your local supervisor) and a progress report detailing your activities and venues at the beginning of each month in order to facilitate:-\r\n\r\n    Smooth operation of your scheduled activities.\r\n    Transport/boats arrangements.\r\n    Notification of the government local authorities responsible throughout the geographic areas you intend to be operating. This is important as it may avoid unnecessary inconveniences.\r\n\r\nUpon your request, IMS can provide you with assistants (Technicians, boat operators etc) to work with you. It is advisable that payment of allowances for assistants, etc, be made at the accounts office. You are therefore advised to deposit some money at the accounts office which can be used for this purpose. However, payment to people outside IMS should be done directly by yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the assistants may also be engaged with other researchers/visiting scientists at IMS. Before engaging them with your research you are required to consult your local supervisor at the Institute and the Superintendent of Laboratories (with details of your field plan) for approval in order to avoid confusion. Please note that activities such as making appointments with offices outside IMS or visiting other Government institutions can be done by yourself in consultation with the Associate Directors’ Office (which could assist in making the appointments for you on request).\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATION\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Institute does not provide accommodation to visiting researchers. However, it assists in obtaining them.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Institute does not provide insurance cover for visitors. The Institute is, therefore, in no way responsible for any damage or accident (at sea or on land) that may occur to any visitor.\r\nPlease make sure you have signed the Visitors form which is available at the desk of the Secretary for the Visiting Scientists/Students on your arrival at the institute. This is for record purposes.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL ASSISTANCE\r\n\r\nIn case you need to see a Doctor please contact the In-Charge of Visiting Scientists or Associate Director for assistance.\r\n\r\nWe have some medical facilities for emergency use in our dispensary located at the ground floor.\r\n\r\nDEPARTING IMS\r\n\r\nAt the end of your stay it is expected that any equipment you have used is returned to its correct place, and any problems that you may have encountered with it have been reported to the laboratory staff. Furthermore, in case you have spent the last bit of a specific chemical or laboratory item, please ensure that the item has been reported to the Technician in-charge so that it can be replaced or renewed.\r\n\r\nFinally, since your visit to IMS will hopefully be productive, it is expected that all visiting researchers present a report and/or a seminar to the IMS staff so that we can all share the new knowledge generated by your research. It will also be gratefully appreciated if you could send a copy of any published material resulting from your work at IMS. We also encourage joint publications with IMS scientists that have assisted you in your work preparation and implementation. However, this could be discussed between you and your supervisors/researchers.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read these short notes, we hope your visit with us is pleasant and productive.\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\nPlease contact the In-charge of Visiting Scientists:\r\n\r\nDr. Mwanahija Shalli\r\nEmail: shalli@ims.udsm.ac.tz\r\n\r\nUpdated: July, 2015\r\n', 'Welcome to the Institute of Marine sciences (IMS) of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) and to Tanzania in general.

Should you wish to use one of the Institute’s boats then you have two options: Either\r\n(a) You provide the fuel, pay the assistants and pay 20% of the market price; or\r\n(b) You pay 90% of the market price and be provided with fuel and boatman.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you will be requested to deposit some money with the Institute’s Accountants’ office.\r\n\r\nDestination 	Cost in TZS\r\nChumbe 	120,000\r\nBawe 	80,000\r\nChanguu 	70,000\r\nChapwani 	80,000\r\nMorogo 	80,000\r\nNyange 	90,000\r\nPange 	80,000\r\nPwakuu 	90,000\r\n\r\nWORK SCHEDULE\r\n\r\nYou are required to provide a work plan to the Associate Director (through your local supervisor) and a progress report detailing your activities and venues at the beginning of each month in order to facilitate:-\r\n\r\n    Smooth operation of your scheduled activities.\r\n    Transport/boats arrangements.\r\n    Notification of the government local authorities responsible throughout the geographic areas you intend to be operating. This is important as it may avoid unnecessary inconveniences.\r\n\r\nUpon your request, IMS can provide you with assistants (Technicians, boat operators etc) to work with you. It is advisable that payment of allowances for assistants, etc, be made at the accounts office. You are therefore advised to deposit some money at the accounts office which can be used for this purpose. However, payment to people outside IMS should be done directly by yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the assistants may also be engaged with other researchers/visiting scientists at IMS. Before engaging them with your research you are required to consult your local supervisor at the Institute and the Superintendent of Laboratories (with details of your field plan) for approval in order to avoid confusion. Please note that activities such as making appointments with offices outside IMS or visiting other Government institutions can be done by yourself in consultation with the Associate Directors’ Office (which could assist in making the appointments for you on request).\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATION\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Institute does not provide accommodation to visiting researchers. However, it assists in obtaining them.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Institute does not provide insurance cover for visitors. The Institute is, therefore, in no way responsible for any damage or accident (at sea or on land) that may occur to any visitor.\r\nPlease make sure you have signed the Visitors form which is available at the desk of the Secretary for the Visiting Scientists/Students on your arrival at the institute. This is for record purposes.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL ASSISTANCE\r\n\r\nIn case you need to see a Doctor please contact the In-Charge of Visiting Scientists or Associate Director for assistance.\r\n\r\nWe have some medical facilities for emergency use in our dispensary located at the ground floor.\r\n\r\nDEPARTING IMS\r\n\r\nAt the end of your stay it is expected that any equipment you have used is returned to its correct place, and any problems that you may have encountered with it have been reported to the laboratory staff. Furthermore, in case you have spent the last bit of a specific chemical or laboratory item, please ensure that the item has been reported to the Technician in-charge so that it can be replaced or renewed.\r\n\r\nFinally, since your visit to IMS will hopefully be productive, it is expected that all visiting researchers present a report and/or a seminar to the IMS staff so that we can all share the new knowledge generated by your research. It will also be gratefully appreciated if you could send a copy of any published material resulting from your work at IMS. We also encourage joint publications with IMS scientists that have assisted you in your work preparation and implementation. However, this could be discussed between you and your supervisors/researchers.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read these short notes, we hope your visit with us is pleasant and productive.\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\nPlease contact the In-charge of Visiting Scientists:\r\n\r\nDr. Mwanahija Shalli\r\nEmail: shalli@ims.udsm.ac.tz\r\n\r\nUpdated: July, 2015\r\n', NULL, '', '', 'institutes/ims/information-for-visitors', 'CT_HCTR', '', 1, 1);
